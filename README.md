# DCN 2023 Fall Socket Programming Project
Socket programming project created for SNU ECE 2023 Fall **Introduction to Data Communication Networks** class, in which I am the head TA.

Includes three socket applications:

1. Echo server (Tutorial Project)
2. HTTP server (Includes GET, POST, HTTP Authentication)
3. BitTorrent-like P2P file-sharing application

Please refer to the included "[Project 1] Socket Programming.pdf" for project details for the HTTP server and the torrent application.

Last year's project is available at [https://github.com/cakeng/DCN_2022_FALL_Torrent](https://github.com/cakeng/DCN_2022_FALL_Torrent)
